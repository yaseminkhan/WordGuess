# WordGuess

#### Overview
This project originated as a simple command-line Word Guess game developed for an introductory coding class. The game is inspired by **Wordle**, where the player attempts to guess a 5-letter word within a set number of tries.

To continue improving my Python skills, I revisited the project and added a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using the **Tkinter** library. This provided an opportunity to learn the basics of building user interfaces in Python and make the game more interactive.

#### How the Game Works
- The game randomly selects a 5-letter word from a predefined list.
- The player has 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
- After each guess:
  - Letters that are correct and in the correct position turn **green**.
  - Letters that are correct but in the wrong position turn **yellow**.
- The game concludes when the player either guesses the word or uses all attempts.
